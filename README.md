# AVA JSPM Loader Plugin

## Update

Don't use this. Honestly. If you want to use JSPM, in fact, don't use AVA at all. It just doesn't work nicely, and there's no hack that can fix that (though this one tried.)

## If You Still Really Think You Want This, Then

In order to use this with AVA, please view the AVA JSPM recipe in [AVA's GitHub
documentation](https://github.com/avajs/ava/tree/master/docs/recipes).
